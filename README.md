# Customer Segmentation and Clustering Analysis
## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis on customer segmentation and clustering using KMeans. The dataset includes customer information such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score from a shopping mall. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to aid in targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Steps:
1. Data Import and Initial Exploration: Loaded the dataset and performed descriptive statistics to understand the basic characteristics.
2. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: Visualized distributions of key variables and explored relationships between them, focusing on differences by gender.
3. Correlation Analysis: Generated a heatmap to show correlations between variables.
4. Clustering Analysis:
#### * Univariate Clustering: Clustered based on annual income.
#### * Bivariate Clustering: Clustered based on annual income and spending score.
#### * Multivariate Clustering: Clustered using all key variables after scaling and encoding categorical data.
5. Cluster Evaluation: Analyzed the characteristics and gender distribution of each cluster to provide actionable insights.

#### The final results offer a clear segmentation of customers, which can be used to tailor marketing campaigns effectively. The processed dataset with cluster labels was saved for further analysis.
